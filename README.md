# odin-recipes
This project is a basic recipe website, which will consist of a main index page that links out to a few recipes.

The project is meant to showcase basic HTML and CSS skills acquired from TOP's HTML and CSS Foundations modules. This includes generating a boilerplate, working with basic HTML elements (i.e. headings, paragraphs, ordered/unordered lists), and applying basic CSS properties via an external style sheet. 

This project will also demonstrate some working knowledge of utilizing Git/GitHub, practicing good commit messages/history, and working with file structures using the command line.
