# odin-recipes
This project is a basic recipe website, which will consist of a main index page that links out to a few recipes.

While bare bones, this project is meant to showcase the foundational HTML knowledge learned from this module. This includes generating a boilerplate, working with basic HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, ordered/unordered lists, and more. 

This project will also demonstrate some basic knowledge of working with Git/GitHub, practicing good commit messages, and working with file structures using the command line.
